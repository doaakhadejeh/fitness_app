## 🏋️‍♀️ Fitness App  

### 🎓 Graduation Project | Flutter & Laravel  

A full-featured **fitness management application** built with **Flutter** (frontend) and **Laravel** (backend).  
This project was developed as a **graduation project** to demonstrate clean and scalable code architecture, using Flutter’s **CMV (Controller–Model–View)** structure and the **HTTP** package for API communication.  

The app provides a complete fitness ecosystem with **three user roles** — *Admin, Trainer, and User* — each with different permissions and functionality.

### 🚀 Key Features  

#### 👑 **Admin**
- Manage users, trainers, and other admins.  
- Create, edit, and delete **workout** and **meal plans**.  
- Manage exercises, nutrition items, and general app data.  

#### 🏋️‍♂️ **Trainer**
- Supervise assigned users.  
- Create and assign **custom workout** and **meal plans** for users.  
- Chat with users for progress tracking and guidance.  

#### 👤 **User**
- Create a **health profile** (weight, height, goals, etc.).  
- View **general workout and meal plans**.  
- Receive **personalized plans** based on health data.

### 🏗️ Project Structure 

```lib/
┣ core/
┣ controller/
┣ data/
┃ ┣ model/
┃ ┗ remote/
┣ view/
┗ main.dart```

This structure follows a clean separation of concerns between **data**, **controllers**, and **UI**, ensuring maintainable and organized code.
